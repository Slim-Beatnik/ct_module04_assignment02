I spent a year studying graphic design as a major in college and switched majors.
So after the old college try... It's not my bag and people use programs for design now.

That said, I made it look as goofy as most small town comicons.

What I got from it:
1.	basic fetch API structure
2.	the functional differences of innerHTML in div tags vs. iframe tags
3. 	various tidbits about css and jQuery - not-irrelevant, simply not implemented.
4.	loading html files into a div will still show the correct title on the webBrowser if you remove the title tags from the main page
